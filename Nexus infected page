I have never used Github before so I don't know if this is going to work but someone needs to do something about this ASAP!!!
My username is SmexyTempest.
I was looking for mods and when I clicked on this page: 
https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/32669/?tab=description
It tried to download 8 viruses. I was wondering wtf was going on so I whent to the comments section and then back to 
description and IT TRIED IT AGAIN. There is some kind of script on this page that is trying to infect computers.
In the posts the auther said "he sees no reason to take the mod down" even though it's dead and I think we can all guess why now.
If moderators try to visit this page to take it down make sure your anti-virus is running...
